## Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is a website about me, my interests and some stuff related to music and a rock band where I sing and play guitars.

It contains 4 html pages and 2 stylesheet files. It is possible to get from any page on this website to any other page by following hyperlinks in _Navbar_. Which I implemented using **Bootstrap**.

**style.css** uses:

1. At least 5 different css properties;
2. At least five different types of CSS selectors;
3. Includes one mobile-responsive @media query


**variables.scss**

- Contains two variables `$bgcolor and `$color to modify the footer included in all the `.html pages of the site (SCSS variables)
- Contains a general pattern `%rodape that inherits to the `.footer class (SCSS Inheritance)
- `.footer class has `span that modifies the text in the footer contained in all span nested in `.footer class (SCSS nesting)

**index.html**
